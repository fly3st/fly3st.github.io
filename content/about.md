My name is Daniel Huri, I'm an offensive security nerd mostly but I also write and draw comics on my spare time [right here](https://www.instagram.com/_dannyh).

I'm currently studying the fundementals of IT and offensive security and actively documenting my experience and methodology.
I enjoy fiddeling with new tech whether it's a new framework or even simple hardware projects, if you'd like to see what I'm up to, check out my blog section.
